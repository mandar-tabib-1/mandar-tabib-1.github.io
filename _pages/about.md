I am a Research scientist at SINTEF, Norway. I have been working in field of fluid dynamics, with some of my recent research being in field of combining fluid dynamics and machine learning through hybrid analytics and modelling. Some of the recent works have been presented at conferences and published. To those interested in this area can read more about my work in the following publications: \
