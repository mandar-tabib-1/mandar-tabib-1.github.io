I am a Research scientist at SINTEF, Norway. I have been working in field of fluid dynamics with applications in wind energy, multiphase flows  and chemical engineering.  Some of my recent research interest is in combining physics-based models like computational fluid dynamics and machine learning through hybrid analytics and modelling. This involves developing non-intrusive reduced order models using deep learning. For more details, you are requested to see the publications under either my google scholar link or ORCID link. Thank you.
